What is Listening Party?

Listening Party is a collaborative listening and playlist building app. In short, you and your friends, family, and even strangers, can hop into a virtual room and listen to the same song at the same time together.

How do I use Listening Party?

1.  Navigate to a pre-made channel or create your own channel.

2.  Use the built-in Spotify catalog search to find music and then add the songs to the playlist.

3.  Use our built-in music controller to play, pause, or seek a track.

4.  Invite friends, family, strangers, to join the party!

Does Listening Party support other streaming platforms (ex. Apple Music, local files)?
